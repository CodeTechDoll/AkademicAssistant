## Elven Races

Players can choose their character's elven race based on ear orientation. Each race has its own unique culture and traditions:

### High Elves

Focused on intellectual pursuits and grace, high elves gain one free rank in a Knowledge skill and one free rank in the Cool skill.

Closely connected to nature, wood elves gain one free rank in the Survival skill and one free rank in the Ranged skill.

## The Call

Elves are driven by "the call," an inner urging that compels them to journey into the unknown wastes. During character creation, players can choose if their elf has already answered the call, is currently experiencing the call, or has not yet experienced it. This choice can have narrative implications and may provide the character with additional connections, motivations, or personal goals.
