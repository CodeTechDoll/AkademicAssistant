## Angels

### Overview

Angels in Aelysia are bound by duty to the "Voice" of their god and follow the religious order known as the "Angelic Choir." They are organized into various Orders, each led by an Archangel, and possess unique abilities that reflect their domains. Angels are known for their majestic and awe-inspiring appearance.

### Special Abilities

**Divine Hierarchy**: Angels are bound by a divine hierarchy that influences their actions and decision-making. When an angel is given an order by a higher-ranking angel, they receive a number of setback dice on any check to resist that order equal to the difference in presence between the two angels. This represents the weight of divine authority and the difficulty for lower-ranking angels to defy their superiors.

**Bound By Duty**: Angels experience a constant connection to the Voice of their god. During character creation, players should determine their angel's relationship with the Voice and how it influences their life and decisions.

**Angelic Choir**: Angels belong to one of the Orders within the Angelic Choir. During character creation, players choose their angel's Order, which provides unique abilities and skills based on their domain.

### Angelic Orders

#### The Crown

### Angelic Abilities

In addition to their Order-specific abilities, all angels possess minor abilities or traits shared across all Orders, such as:

- Limited Flight: Angels can hover and fly short distances at a speed equal to their normal walking speed.
- Divine Presence: Angels can spend a maneuver to radiate an aura of divine presence that instills awe and reverence in those who behold them. This aura can provide a boost die on social skill checks or impose a setback die on hostile actions targeting the angel, at the GM's discretion.
