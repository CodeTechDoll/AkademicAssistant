# Archetypes

This folder contains a collection of archetypes for the Aelysia setting. This will represent your character's abilities, skills, and talents, and will help you define your character's role in the party. Archetypes are a great way to customize your character and make them unique, and can be used to represent a variety of different themes and concepts.

## Overview of Archetypes

### Build Your Own Archetype

If you're looking to create a custom archetype for your character, you can do so by following the steps below:

1. **Choose a Theme**: First, choose a theme for your archetype. This can be anything from a specific profession or role to a particular personality trait or skill. For example, you might choose the theme of "Magical Researcher" or "Mercenary".

2. *Buy Characteristics*: Next, using a pool of experience no more than 175, increase your character's characteristics to reflect the theme of your archetype. For example, if you chose the theme of "Magical Researcher", you might increase your character's Intellect characteristic to 3 and your Presence characteristic to 2. All characteristics start at 1.
