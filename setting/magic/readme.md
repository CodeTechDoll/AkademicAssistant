# Magic

## Basic Types

### Mana Magic

Magic that utilizes the natural ambient energy known as "mana". This type of magic involves learning to sense and control an ambient energy that exists overlapping much of the material world. To cast a spell, one shapes mana in such a way that it forms some resultant effect. For example, a skilled mana mage might draw upon the surrounding mana to create a barrier of energy, deflecting incoming projectiles or shielding allies from harm. The very fabric of Aelysia and the Unknown Wastes is interwoven with mana, making it an abundant resource for those who know how to harness it.

### Evocation

Magic that uses the power of "evoking" some entity. In this case, entities that exist within the Void will grant power or perform "miracles" for those that adhere to their beliefs, rituals, or customs. Evocation magic relies on establishing a connection with these powerful beings, who may range from benevolent deities to capricious spirits. An example of an evocation spell might involve invoking a fire spirit to imbue a weapon with flames, granting it additional fire damage for a limited time.

### Innate/Imbuing

Magic that one uses via power granted to them from someone else. Usually, this is done via a "mantled" person (e.g., the Queen of the Elves) using the unique powers granted to them from their assumed identity to then partition out abilities and powers to those that follow them. A common way of doing this is by imbuing someone with a "sigil engraved onto their soul" that represents their connection to their higher power. This sigil could manifest in various ways, such as glowing markings on the recipient's skin or even as a physical amulet that they must wear to access their powers.

## How to do It

In all cases, any manner of beliefs, rituals, customs, or ideas can be associated with any practice of magic. What is crucial is that adherents have both the ability (when necessary) and the *fervent belief in* their magical tradition to perform magic.

A shaman that evokes Mother Gaia in order to perform healing via potions might find her ability waning when she begins to lose her way and seek out the excesses of materialistic, corporate life. This is because she is losing her *belief* in her practice and not because of some innate 'magicality' of the natural earth vs. material living.

## Dreamers

**Dreamers** are a subtype of magic users quite different from the rest. Born with an innate connection to the Void, Dreamers are able to shift reality in ways that are almost godlike, yet are wholly bound to an existence of constantly straddling two planes of reality: the material and the Void. While many do not describe this as something to suffer (indeed, those few Dreamers that exist live lives of extreme power), Dreamers will forever be set apart from all other types of beings.

Dreamers are necessary for things that would be wholly impossible even with magic, such as the great acts of reality-warping that allowed for the ancient Star-Vessels that once sailed the cosmic oceans to cross the vast distances between the stars.

However, there are no more than 3 confirmed Dreamers currently known to be alive:

1. Her Holiness, the Divine Voice and Leader of the Angelic Choir, Seraphina the Radiant.
2. A mysterious figure known only as the "Wanderer," rumored to travel the Unknown Wastes in search of lost knowledge and hidden secrets.
3. "Z," the anonymous Dreamer serving on the board of the mega-corp conglomerate known as "ManaTech," who is believed to be the driving force behind their cutting-edge magitech innovations and breakthroughs.
