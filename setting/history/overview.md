# History of Thalea and Aelysia

## Overview

The history of Thalea is one marked by the convergence of ancient elven civilization and human ingenuity, brought together by the arrival of a great starship from across the cosmos. Over time, this fusion has given rise to a world of incredible magitech and vast, bustling cities, punctuated by the remnants of long-lost eras and the ever-present dangers of the Unknown Wastes.

## Ancient History

For millennia, the elves of Thalea have lived in harmony with the chaotic mana swarms that ripple across the Unknown Wastes. Their deep connection to the arcane allowed them to survive and even thrive in this tumultuous environment. The elven civilization, known as the Eternal Enclave, was a beacon of art, culture, and magic, spreading its influence across the planet.

## Arrival of the Humans

Around 3,000 years ago, a great starship carrying human settlers arrived on Thalea. The humans, fascinated by the elven mastery of the arcane, formed an alliance with the Eternal Enclave. This union led to a golden age of exploration and innovation, as the two races worked together to advance their understanding of the arcana and develop magitech.

Key figures during this time included:

- **Eloran Silverleaf**, an elven archmage who shared his people's knowledge of the arcane with the newly arrived humans.
- **Captain Amelia Starborn**, the leader of the human settlers, who forged the alliance with the elves and oversaw the construction of Aelysia, the first human city on Thalea.

## Rise and Fall of Factions

Over time, various factions rose and fell as the two races continued to integrate and develop their knowledge and technology. Some of these factions included:

- **The Arcanum**: A powerful organization of mages and scholars, dedicated to unraveling the secrets of the cosmos and the arcane. Their influence waned as magitech became more widespread and accessible.
- **The Celestial Order**: A religious group that sought to maintain the purity of ancient elven teachings and resisted the influence of human culture. This faction eventually dissolved as the two races became more intertwined.
- **The ManaTech Conglomerate**: A powerful magitech corporation that has risen to prominence in recent years, driving innovation and magitech breakthroughs, largely due to the anonymous Dreamer, "Z," on their board of directors.

## The Modern Era

Thalea has now evolved into a bustling world teeming with life, with Aelysia as its crown jewel. The city boasts a magitech orbital elevator, connecting the planet to the stars above. The architectural style of the era combines 1920s Art Deco with the futuristic magitech, science fantasy, and cyberpunk influences.

Hidden societies and factions still exist in the chaos of the Unknown Wastes, preserving ancient traditions and secrets, while the urban centers of Thalea continue to push the boundaries of magitech and arcane knowledge.

The modern era is marked by the delicate balance of progress and preservation, as Thaleans navigate the complexities of their ever-evolving world.

### Arrival of Angels and Demons

In addition to the elves and humans, Thalea has also seen the arrival of otherworldly beings known as angels and demons. Both species possess the unique ability to travel through the Void, a mysterious and dangerous realm that exists beyond the boundaries of the known universe.

The angels, celestial beings of light and benevolence, arrived on Thalea seeking harmony and enlightenment. They brought with them their vast knowledge and wisdom, which they shared with the inhabitants of the world. The angels established the Angelic Choir, a powerful and influential organization led by their Divine Voice, Mesatria the Radiant.

The demons, on the other hand, are beings of darkness and chaos, driven by their desires and ambition. They arrived on Thalea with the goal of expanding their influence and asserting their dominance over the other races. Despite their seemingly sinister nature, the demons' resourcefulness and self-determination have led to the rise of various factions and secret societies that wield considerable power and influence in the shadows of Thalea and while many still fear the demons, they have also come to respect their cunning and resolve and realize that they are not all evil.

Both races have been able to travel through the Void, allowing them to explore the cosmos and gather knowledge and resources. However, the Void is a dangerous place, and the angels and demons have been forced to develop powerful magitech and arcane technologies to protect themselves from the dangers of the Unknown Wastes.

Unfortunately and for unknown reasons over time, the ability to travel through the Void has either been lost or become an extremely well-guarded secret, known only to the highest and most powerful members of the angelic and demonic factions. This has led to a delicate balance of power between the races, as they vie for control over the planet's resources and secrets, all while contending with the ever-present dangers of the Unknown Wastes and the chaotic mana swarms that surround them.
