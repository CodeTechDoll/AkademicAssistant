# Hymn of the Exarchic Choir

O Mesatria, Crown of Life, ascendant,
Whose Voice dost guide our steps and spirits true,
We pray thee, grant us balance, understanding,
Thine Exarchic wisdom shining through.

Raziel, Wisdom's keeper, and Tzapha,
Compassion's voice, to thee our prayers we raise,
That in thy grace we may embrace our purpose,
And walk the path of Her eternal ways.

Zaskiel, Mercy's champion, and Chamuel,
Strength's iron heart, steadfast and unbent,
Beseech we now, thy gentle aid and courage,
To face our trials and our foes unspent.

Tiphael and Phyr, Beauty's dual visage,
In radiant splendor, glorious and bright,
May we reflect thy grace in all our actions,
And bring to Her our world, a wondrous sight.

Haniel, Eternity's enduring spirit,
And Gabrael, Foundation's firm embrace,
Upon thy guidance and celestial wisdom,
We lean, to weave our mortal lives with grace.

Sathima, Mortals' shepherd, we invoke thee,
Thine inspiration in our dreams to dwell,
Through music, hope, and all our aspirations,
Her sacred plan, our hearts shall ever tell.

Exarchic Choir, in unity resplendent,
Your voices joined, Her presence we extol,
Within our souls, thine angelic harmonies,
Echo, and guide us to our sacred goal.
