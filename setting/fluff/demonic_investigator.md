# A Demonic Investigation

It was raining in the city that night, the kind of rain that makes everything look like an oil painting. The streets were slick with a million colors, a kaleidoscope of neon signs and car headlights reflecting off the wet pavement. My name's Narax, a demon investigator specializing in the unsavory side of life. I walked into my office, shaking off the rain like a wet dog, and lit a cigarette.

The phone on my desk rang, the shrill sound cutting through the haze of smoke that filled the room. I picked up the receiver, my voice gruff and weary.

"Who's this?" I asked.

"Ah, Narax, just the demon I was looking for," the voice on the other end purred. It was Yaldao, the Lust demon, well-known for her extravagant parties and unmatched charm. "I've got a little problem, and I heard you're the best in the business."

"What's the trouble?" I inquired, leaning back in my chair and taking a drag from my cigarette.

"A dear friend of mine has gone missing," Yaldao explained, her voice tinged with concern. "Her name's Vexara, a demon of Wrath. She's been trying to expose some shady dealings involving a few high-profile figures in the city. I'm afraid she might've gotten in over her head."

I sighed, rubbing my temples. "I'll look into it, Yaldao. But I'm warning you, this city's got more secrets than a demon's got sins."

"Thank you, Narax. I knew I could count on you," she replied, relief evident in her voice.

I spent the next few days digging around, asking questions, and getting my hands dirty. The city's underbelly was a cesspool of corruption and greed, and Vexara's investigation had rattled some powerful cages. She'd been looking into a partnership between Mammon, the Greed demon tycoon, and a mortal businessman named Carmichael. Together, they were planning to seize control of the city's most vulnerable neighborhoods, gentrifying them into soulless high-rises and luxury boutiques.

It didn't take long for me to realize that Vexara had become a liability to their scheme. The trail led me to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, where I found her bound and gagged, beaten within an inch of her life.

I cut her free, and she looked up at me with fire in her eyes, the Wrath demon's indomitable spirit still burning strong. "Thank you, Narax. We need to expose them, bring them to justice."

I nodded, my jaw set with determination. "Yeah, kid. We'll take them down, together."

The city may have been a cesspool, but every now and then, even a demon like me could make a difference, and maybe, just maybe, cleanse a little bit of the filth that stained its streets.

In the end, Mammon and Carmichael's plans were brought to light, but little was done. Sure the paperwork had been filed and some mid-level pencil-jockey had been iced but the city still had more shadows than I could ever hope to shine light on.

Still, Vexara and I, well, we continued our work, seeking out injustice and shining a light on the darkness that lurked in the shadows. We were demons, sure, but we had our own twisted sense of justice, and that was enough for us.
