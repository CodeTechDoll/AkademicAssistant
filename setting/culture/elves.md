# Elves

## Enhanced Senses and Fortitude

Elves possess slightly enhanced senses and greater bodily fortitude compared to other races. Their keen senses grant them superior perception, while their strong constitution allows them to endure harsh conditions and resist various forms of physical harm.

## Social Structure and Values

Elves have a generally socialistic approach to living, valuing the well-being of the community as a whole. They believe in the importance of being true to oneself and others, striving to live in a manner that benefits all. While not a hive mind, elves have a strong sense of unity and interconnectedness.

This mindset can create challenges for some elves, as the ideal of a flourishing life is often difficult to achieve in practice. Individual elves may struggle with balancing their personal desires and ambitions with the needs of their community.

## Physical Appearance and Adaptability

Elves come in all shapes and sizes, but they generally possess a more aesthetically appealing appearance. This trait is a result of the 
genius in their genetics, as they designed the elven race to subtly and slowly adapt to their environment over time. As such, elves living in different regions may develop unique physical features that reflect their surroundings.

Elves are known for their long lifespans, pointed ears, and slender, graceful physiques. Their beauty and adaptability make them a captivating and enduring presence in the universe.

## Elven Races

In this world, elves are divided into different racial groups based on ear orientation. These distinctions are mostly superficial and cultural, rather than indicative of any inherent abilities or attributes. Each elven race has its own unique culture and traditions, shaped by the environments in which they live.

### High Elves

High elves are characterized by their tall, pointed ears that angle upwards. They often hold positions of influence and power, valuing education, art, and intellectual pursuits. High elves are known for their grace and sophistication, and their society places great importance on maintaining proper etiquette and decorum.

### Wood Elves

Wood elves have short, upward-pointing ears. They are closely connected to nature and often live in forested regions, where they have developed a deep understanding of the flora and fauna that surrounds them. Wood elves are skilled hunters and trackers, and their culture emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with the natural world.

### Dark Elves

Dark elves are distinguished by their ears that point outwards. They typically inhabit underground environments, such as caves or deep tunnels, and have adapted to a life of darkness and seclusion. Dark elves are resourceful and resilient, known for their adaptability and ability to navigate the subterranean world with ease.

### Sea Elves

Sea elves have ears that point backwards. They are a coastal-dwelling race, with a culture that revolves around the ocean and its bounties. Sea elves are exceptional swimmers and sailors, with many members of their race possessing a deep knowledge of the marine environment and its creatures.

It is important to note that the abilities and traits associated with each elven race are primarily shaped by their cultural experiences and environments, rather than any inherent biological differences. For example, sea elves are not inherently better swimmers than dark elves, but their coastal lifestyle and cultural focus on swimming and sailing contribute to their proficiency in these areas.

## Elven Culture in Aelysa

Elves have adapted well to life in the mega city, occupying various walks of life where their natural abilities give them an advantage. Their enhanced senses, grace, and beauty make them ideal candidates for careers in sports, fashion, entertainment, and other fields where physical prowess and aesthetics are highly valued.

Some elves choose to fully embrace the fast-paced, technology-driven lifestyle of the mega city, while others maintain a connection to their traditional values and cultural practices. It's not uncommon to find elven enclaves within the city where ancient customs and rituals are preserved and passed down through generations.

Despite their success in the urban environment, many elves feel a deep connection to nature and the unknown wastes, resulting in an underlying longing for a simpler, more harmonious existence.

## Elven Culture in the Unknown Wastes

In the unknown wastes, elven communities adopt a more naturalistic approach to life, living in harmony with the environment and following the ancient traditions passed down by their ancestors. These elves are skilled in the arts of survival, tracking, and hunting, utilizing their enhanced senses to navigate the chaotic and untamed landscape of the wastes.

Elves in the unknown wastes have a deep respect for the world around them, following a spiritual path that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living things. They often form close-knit communities, working together to protect and nurture the land and its creatures.

## The Call

Nearly all elves experience "the call," an inner urging that compels them to journey into the unknown wastes in search of a mysterious, yet unknown destination. This call is a powerful and integral part of elven culture, prompting many to embark on a pilgrimage of self-discovery at some point in their lives.

The call can manifest at any stage of an elf's life, often signaling a pivotal moment in their personal journey. It's believed that by following the call, an elf will gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world.

These pilgrimages are deeply personal experiences, and it's rare for an elf to share the details of their journey with others. Those who complete their pilgrimage often return with a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper connection to their heritage.
