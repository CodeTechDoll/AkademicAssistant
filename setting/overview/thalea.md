# Thalea: The World of Aelysia

## Overview

Thalea is a planet similar to Earth in many ways, with a diverse range of ecosystems, climates, and terrains. However, what sets Thalea apart is the presence of a single, sprawling mega city known as Aelysia, which covers a vast portion of the planet's surface. This enormous urban expanse is home to billions of inhabitants and has a rich history steeped in magic and technological innovation.

Outside the confines of Aelysia lies the mysterious and treacherous region known as the Unknown Wastes. These areas are saturated with chaotic mana, disrupting communication, rendering satellites useless, and making travel exceedingly dangerous.

## Geography and Climate

Thalea has a diverse range of ecosystems and climates, similar to Earth. It features vast oceans, mountain ranges, expansive forests, and arid deserts. The climate varies depending on the region, with some areas experiencing extreme temperatures, while others enjoy more temperate conditions.

However, the mega city of Aelysia has transformed a large portion of the planet's surface. The sprawling urban expanse has consumed much of the natural landscape, replacing it with towering skyscrapers, immense magitech factories, and densely packed residential areas.

In contrast, the Unknown Wastes are largely uninhabited and unexplored. These regions are characterized by chaotic and unpredictable weather patterns, violent mana storms, and otherworldly phenomena, making them inhospitable to most forms of life.

## Aelysia: The Mega City

Aelysia is a marvel of magical and technological innovation, with a rich history that spans millennia. The city is divided into numerous districts, each with its own unique culture, architectural style, and governing body. The center of the city is dominated by the prestigious "Akadaemies," institutions that specialize in various fields of magical research and education.

Some of the key districts within Aelysia include:

- The Arcanum District, known for its magical research facilities and libraries.
- The Exarchic District, a haven for the angelic choir and their supporters.
- The Gilded District, a bustling hub of trade and commerce.
- The Mechano District, where cutting-edge magitech is developed and produced.
- The Slumbering District, a more residential area with diverse architectural styles reflecting the various cultures that call Aelysia home.

The city is a melting pot of different races, cultures, and magical traditions, which has contributed to the development of advanced magitech that seamlessly blends magic and technology. This has led to incredible advancements in various fields, such as transportation, communication, healthcare, and entertainment.

Some notable means of transportation in Aelysia include:

- MagiRails, high-speed trains that run on mana-infused tracks, connecting different districts and even remote regions outside the city.
- SkyCabs, small flying vehicles that can be hailed like taxis, powered by magitech engines.
- Portals, magical gateways that allow for instantaneous travel between different areas of the city.

Notable landmarks within and outside Aelysia include:

- The Grand Akadaemie, the oldest and most prestigious magical institution in the city.
- The Crystal Spires, a cluster of skyscrapers made entirely of enchanted crystal, which serve as the headquarters for various ManaTech corporations.
- The Harmony Gardens, a massive park located in the heart of the city, known for its enchanted flora and peaceful atmosphere.
- The Celestial Observatory, a structure located at the edge of the city that allows for the study of the cosmos and the tracking of celestial bodies.
- The Great Mana Falls, a natural wonder located outside the city where a river of pure mana cascades down from a towering cliff.
