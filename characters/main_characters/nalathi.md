Elf (Althari)

## Role

### Queen of the Elves

As queen of the elves, Nalathi is responsible for the well-being of the elves. She is also responsible for the protection of the elves, and the protection of the elven lands.

#### Unbroken Lineage

Nalathi is a mantled identity assumed by an adult elf by ritual. The next Nalathi is chosen by Nalathi herself and is prepared for their future role.  The ritual is a way to ensure that the elves have a strong leader, and that the elves are not left without a leader. This system has worked for as long as any elf can remember and has never been tested for a time where there is no Nalathi in waiting.

## Description

The current Nalathi is a shorter elven woman with an athletic build and stern stature, an unusual turn from the usual beauty of the Althari. Her hair is a dark brown, and her eyes are a deep blue. She is often seen wearing a simple white robe, and a crown of gold and silver.

## Personality

Possessed of a slightly fiery temperment, the Nalathi of the present has a more take-charge attitude when compared to her predecessors. She is a strong leader, and is not afraid to make hard decisions. She is also a very spiritual person, and is often seen meditating or praying.
