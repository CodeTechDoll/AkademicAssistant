## Demons

### Overview

Demons represent the chaotic energies of life and the Void, embodying free expression, free will, and individuality. They are associated with domains inspired by "sins" but with less negative connotations, each demon finding unique and creative ways to express their domain.

### Special Abilities

**Chaotic Essence**: Demons draw power from the chaotic energies of the Void. During character creation, players should determine their demon's relationship with these energies and how it influences their life and decisions.

**Demonic Domains**: Demons are associated with one of the seven domains. During character creation, players choose their demon's domain, which provides unique abilities and skills based on that domain.

### Domains

Players can choose their character's domain, granting them unique abilities and skills associated with that domain:

#### Pride

- Free rank in the Discipline skill
- Free rank in the chosen craft skill (e.g., Art, Performance)

#### Sloth

- Free rank in the Negotiation skill
- Free rank in the Knowledge (Society) skill

#### Greed

- Free rank in the Negotiation skill
- Free rank in the Streetwise skill

#### Envy

- Free rank in the Perception skill
- Free rank in the chosen competition skill (e.g., Athletics, Melee)

#### Lust

#### Wrath

### Demonic Abilities

In addition to their domain-specific abilities, all demons possess minor abilities or traits shared across all domains, such as:

- Void Connection: Demons can draw on the chaotic energies of the Void to enhance their abilities. Once per session, a demon can add a boost die to any skill check related to their domain.
- Demonic Resilience: Demons are resistant to the effects of the Void, granting them a rank in the Resilience skill (this does not stack with the rank from the Wrath domain).
