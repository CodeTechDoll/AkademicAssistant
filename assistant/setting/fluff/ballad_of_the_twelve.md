# The Ballad of The Twelve: An Excerpt from the Divine Tome of Evocation

## Tome: _The Divine Tome of Evocation_, Volume III, Canto XIV

In ages past, when magic flowed,
And mortal realm with wonder glowed,
Twelve mighty heroes graced the land,
United by a sacred band.

Aegis, leader strong and fair,
With bonds of friendship did declare,
To forge a world of unity,
Where loyalty reigned for all to see.

Stormheart, with courage in her veins,
Did brave the tempest's fierce domains,
Her spirit, like the thunder's might,
Inspired warriors in their fight.

Xin, the scholar wise and true,
Upheld the morals all must pursue,
His wisdom taught to every soul,
The path to keep their hearts whole.

Eratessa, beauty's light,
Did spread the arts with love's delight,
Her grace inspired the songs of yore,
Enchanting all forevermore.

Rashanu, the sun's warm glow,
Gave life renewed to all below,
His healing touch brought light and hope,
And with despair, no more to cope.

Tanzmori, cunning as the fox,
Could slip through shadows like a wraith,
In stealth and guile, his followers trained,
Their foes ensnared, their trust regained.

Kokopelo, harvest's boon,
Did dance beneath the silver moon,
Fertility and abundance blessed,
To nurture lands and end their rest.

Hanuvay, with steps so light,
Did dance upon the wind's swift flight,
Her grace and speed, forever free,
Gave flight to those who wished to be.

Odinfar, with knowledge vast,
Craftsmanship and skills amassed,
He taught the art of perfect form,
To shape the world, a new age born.

Meridna, mysteries' embrace,
Led hunters through the untamed space,
The night unveiled, the shadows stirred,
As secrets whispered, undeterred.

Gymir, the ocean's call,
Did guide the sailors through the squall,
Explorers ventured, fears abated,
As unknown realms were navigated.

Rostam, determination's fire,
Urged all to reach for ever higher,
The human spirit, bold and grand,
Triumphed o'er the trials at hand.

These Twelve, in sacred union bound,
Their aspects granted, power profound,
Evoked by those with faith and prayer,
A legacy of magic rare.

In temples, shrines, and hearts they dwell,
Their stories sung, their legends swell,
The Twelve, forever intertwined,
A testament to humankind.
