# Demons

## Overview

Demons, contrary to what some might tell you, are not inherently "evil" but represent the chaotic energies of life and the Void. They embody free expression, free will, and individuality. Demons stand in contrast to the order, hierarchy, and religious zealotry of angels.

## Demonic Domains

Rather than being organized into angelic-style orders, demons are associated with domains inspired by "sins," but with less negative connotations. Each demon is unique and embraces their domain in their own way, often finding creative and unexpected ways to express it.

### Pride

These demons are driven to excel in their chosen fields and work tirelessly to perfect their skills. Pride demons may be amazing artists, talented musicians, or formidable warriors who seek to be the best in their craft.

### Sloth

Sloth demons value relaxation, leisure, and a carefree lifestyle. They may find ways to give back to others through charitable actions, such as donating money or resources, which in turn allows them to enjoy a more relaxed existence.

### Greed

Greed demons are ambitious and resourceful, always seeking to amass wealth and power. They are often shrewd negotiators and keen investors, using their acumen to build vast fortunes.

### Envy

Envy demons are motivated by a desire for the success and achievements of others. Instead of harboring resentment, they use this inspiration to strive for greatness and push themselves to reach new heights.

### Gluttony

Gluttony demons have a deep appreciation for the sensual pleasures of life. They may be gourmets, connoisseurs of fine wine, or enthusiasts of other indulgences, always eager to explore and enjoy the best that life has to offer.

### Lust

Lust demons revel in passion and desire, celebrating the intensity of emotions and connections that drive people together. They may serve as matchmakers, artists of romantic works, or advocates for love and pleasure in all its forms.

### Wrath

Wrath demons embody the raw power of anger and the drive for justice. They can be fierce warriors, relentless avengers, or champions of the downtrodden, using their rage as a force for change and transformation.

## Demonic Society

Demons, by their very nature, eschew hierarchy and prefer to operate as individuals or in loosely organized groups. While they may occasionally collaborate or form alliances based on mutual interests, they generally value their independence and freedom above all else.

Despite their disparate domains and individualistic nature, demons share a common connection to the chaotic energies of the Void. This shared link may lead to moments of unity or cooperation when facing existential threats or challenges that require their combined efforts.

## Demonic Relations with Angels and Mortals

Although demons and angels have opposing worldviews, they are not inherently enemies. Their interactions may vary, from cautious alliances to heated rivalries, depending on the specific individuals and their goals.

Mortals may have a wide range of relationships with demons, from seeking their guidance and wisdom to forming pacts for power and knowledge. Some mortals may even worship or revere demons, seeing them as embodiments of freedom and individuality.

Demons, in turn, may take an interest in the lives of mortals, finding inspiration in their passions and desires. They may act as patrons, mentors, or even friends, forging unique and personal connections with those who capture their interest.
