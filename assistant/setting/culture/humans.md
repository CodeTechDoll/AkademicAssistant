# Humans

## Mana-Infused Physique

Humans in this setting possess a slightly stockier build on average, with their bodies subtly fattened by the rich mana that permeates the city. This mana-infused constitution grants them a modest degree of resilience and adaptability, allowing them to thrive in the diverse environments of Aelysia.

## Physical Appearance and Diversity

Humans come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, reflecting the wide range of cultures and ethnicities that exist within their race. This diversity is a testament to their adaptability and the various environments they have inhabited throughout history.

## Ingenuity and Ambition

Humans are known for their ingenuity and ambition, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with their innovations in magitech and other fields. This drive for progress has led them to be one of the most influential races in the city, with their advancements shaping the course of history.

## Social Structure and Values

Human society is highly stratified, with a complex hierarchy of social classes that are influenced by factors such as wealth, power, and prestige. Despite these divisions, humans place a strong emphasis on individual achievement and self-improvement, valuing hard work and determination as a means to overcome adversity.

While humans are not inherently predisposed to any particular moral alignment, their ambition and drive for success can sometimes lead them to prioritize personal gain over the well-being of others. This has resulted in a diverse range of human personalities, from benevolent leaders and philanthropists to ruthless opportunists and criminals.

## Human Subcultures

Humans in this world have developed various subcultures, each with its own unique identity and set of values. Some of these subcultures are centered around specific industries or professions, while others are formed by groups of like-minded individuals who share a common interest or worldview.

### ManaTech Pioneers

This subculture is composed of scientists, engineers, and inventors who are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of mana-infused technology. They are driven by a desire to create new and innovative applications for the abundant mana that saturates the city, often pursuing their research with an almost obsessive passion.

### Arcane Scholars

Arcane scholars are humans who have devoted their lives to the study and mastery of magic. These individuals are often drawn to the mystical arts by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to unlock the secrets of the universe. Arcane scholars can be found in the hallowed halls of the Akadaemies, as well as in private laboratories and arcane libraries throughout the city.

### The Nightborn

The Nightborn are a subculture of humans who have embraced the darker aspects of life in the city, immersing themselves in the hedonistic pleasures and illicit activities that Aelysia's shadows have to offer. They are often involved in the criminal underworld, either as members of powerful syndicates or as independent operators who walk the razor's edge between law and chaos.

## Human Culture in Aelysa

Human culture in Aelysia is a vibrant and diverse tapestry, reflecting the many different subcultures and ethnicities that coexist within the city. Humans can be found in all walks of life, from the glittering spires of the ManaTech corporations to the grimy alleyways of the criminal underworld.

Despite their diverse backgrounds and values, humans are united by a common drive for progress and innovation, with their ingenuity and ambition shaping the city's destiny. As a result, human culture is a constantly evolving mosaic of ideas and influences, forever adapting to the changing tides of history.
