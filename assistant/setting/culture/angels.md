# Angels

## Bound By Duty

All Angels experience at least some level of extrasensory sensation that they interpret as the guidance of their god- the "Voice" of Her. This Voice is the primary means by which the angels are able to communicate with their god and with each other.

For an Angel, all facets of life are in some way at least influenced by the Voice.

When an angel of a higher ranking gives an order, it can be done using the will of the Voice. In such cases, those duty-bound angels of lesser ranking will feel compelled to obey the order. For vast differences in power or ranking, the lesser angels will often act without even realizing it. However, as power disparity decreases, the angels will begin to feel the Voice more strongly and will be able to resist the order if they so choose, though they will still feel the Voice urging them to obey.

In general, though, it is considered exceedingly rude to utilize these powers to compel others to do your bidding without proper thought and consideration.

## Angelic Choir

Angels follow a religious order known most commonly as the "Angelic Choir."

This consists of a massive hierarchy of adherents, channelers, angels, and mortals all enacting the voice of the angelic prime god and "void entity" known only as Her, who largely communicates via visions and an inner "Voice" that the most faithful claim to hear.

The general hierarchy of the Choir is such that there are separate Orders that are each headed by an Archangel. Each Archangel is wholly responsible for their order and is largely left to their own devices in managing and maintaining their Order, only being accountable to the other members of the Exarchic caste (the other archangels).

Angels typically have a majestic and awe-inspiring appearance, with their physical form often reflecting their particular domain or specialization. For example, Chamuel, the Archangel of Strength, might have an imposing, muscular build and wield a mighty greatsword, while Haniel, the Archangel of Eternity, could have an ethereal, ageless countenance and be surrounded by a calming aura.

## Angelic Abilities

Angels within their respective Orders possess unique abilities that reflect their domains. These abilities can range from powerful combat techniques to potent healing spells, as well as more subtle powers like enhanced intuition or the ability to inspire others.

For example, members of the Order of Strength might be able to manifest a powerful protective barrier around themselves and their allies or call forth divine energy to smite their foes. In contrast, angels from the Order of Mercy could have the ability to heal wounds, cleanse toxins, and even revive the recently deceased.

Angels may also possess minor abilities or traits shared across all Orders, such as limited flight or an aura of divine presence that can instill awe and reverence in those who behold them.
