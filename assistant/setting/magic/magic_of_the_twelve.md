# The Evocation of the Twelve

## The Source

The Twelve Deific Humans derive their power from a primordial source of magic, known as the Aether. This mysterious energy permeates the fabric of the universe and is responsible for the creation and sustenance of all magical abilities.

## The Aetheric Connection

When a follower of the Twelve forms a connection with their chosen deity, they are essentially tapping into the Aether, channeling its energy through their bond with the deity. This connection allows them to manifest magical abilities related to the deity's divine aspect, such as summoning lightning or manipulating the earth.

## Aetheric Affinities

Individuals in your world may possess innate affinities for specific aspects of the Aether, which can influence their choice of deity and the nature of the magical abilities they develop. These affinities can be inherited, developed through intense study or practice, or granted by the deity as a reward for devotion or exceptional service.

## Aetheric Artifacts

Throughout history, powerful artifacts imbued with the Aether's energy have been crafted or discovered. These relics possess unique abilities related to the Twelve Deific Humans, and their power can be accessed by those with the proper knowledge or connection to the respective deity.

## Aetheric Rituals and Rites

Followers of the Twelve perform rituals and rites to strengthen their connection to the Aether and their chosen deity. These ceremonies can include prayer, meditation, offerings, and other acts of devotion. By participating in these rites, followers can enhance their magical abilities and deepen their bond with the deity.

## Aetheric Balance and Duality

The Aether is an ever-present force that seeks balance and harmony. As such, each of the Twelve Deific Humans represents not only their primary aspect but also its complementary aspect. For example, Stormheart embodies strength, courage, and the fury of the storm, but also the calm and tranquility that follows it. Understanding and embracing these dual aspects can unlock new magical abilities and insights for the followers of the Twelve.
