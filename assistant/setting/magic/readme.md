# Magic

## Basic Types

### Mana Magic

Magic that utilizes the natural ambient energy known as "mana". This type of magic involves learning to sense and control an ambient energy that exists overlapping much of the material world. To cast a spell, one shapes mana in such a way that it forms some resultant effect. For example, a skilled mana mage might draw upon the surrounding mana to create a barrier of energy, deflecting incoming projectiles or shielding allies from harm. The very fabric of Aelysia and the Unknown Wastes is interwoven with mana, making it an abundant resource for those who know how to harness it.

#### Mana Manipulation

To master mana magic, practitioners must first learn to sense and control the mana that surrounds them. This involves a combination of mental exercises, meditation, and physical practice to attune their senses and hone their ability to manipulate the energy.

#### Mana Wells and Ley Lines

Mana is not uniformly distributed throughout the world. There are areas where the concentration of mana is higher, often referred to as mana wells or ley lines. These areas are highly sought after by mana mages, as they can significantly boost their magical abilities while within their proximity.

#### Mana Overload and Exhaustion

Utilizing mana magic is not without risks. Overexerting oneself or attempting to manipulate more mana than one's capabilities allow can lead to mana overload, causing physical and mental exhaustion or, in extreme cases, permanent damage to the mage's ability to channel mana.

### Evocation

Magic that uses the power of "evoking" some entity. In this case, entities that exist within the Void will grant power or perform "miracles" for those that adhere to their beliefs, rituals, or customs. Evocation magic relies on establishing a connection with these powerful beings, who may range from benevolent deities to capricious spirits. An example of an evocation spell might involve invoking a fire spirit to imbue a weapon with flames, granting it additional fire damage for a limited time.

#### Evocation Contracts

To form a connection with a Void entity, evocation practitioners must first establish a contract. This agreement sets the terms of the relationship between the mage and the entity, including the rituals, customs, and beliefs the mage must adhere to in exchange for access to the entity's power.

#### Evocation Circles and Rituals

Evocation magic often requires the use of circles and other symbols to focus the power of the entity being invoked. These circles can be drawn or etched on various surfaces and may include runes, sigils, or other symbols representing the deity or spirit.

#### The Balance of Power

A key aspect of evocation magic is maintaining a balance of power between the mage and the invoked entity. While the entity may grant power willingly, it may also attempt to exert its influence over the mage, making it essential for the practitioner to maintain control of the relationship.

### Innate/Imbuing

Magic that one uses via power granted to them from someone else. Usually, this is done via a "mantled" person (e.g., the Queen of the Elves) using the unique powers granted to them from their assumed identity to then partition out abilities and powers to those that follow them. A common way of doing this is by imbuing someone with a "sigil engraved onto their soul" that represents their connection to their higher power. This sigil could manifest in various ways, such as glowing markings on the recipient's skin or even as a physical amulet that they must wear to access their powers.

#### The Mantling Process

To imbue others with magical abilities, a mantled individual must first undergo a process known as mantling. This involves forming a deep spiritual connection with the source of their power, often through intense meditation, prayer, or other acts of devotion.

#### Sigils of Power

When imbuing another with magical abilities, a mantled person creates a sigil that represents the individual's connection to their source of power. This sigil is often complex and unique to each person, embodying their specific strengths, weaknesses, and potential for growth.

#### The Bond of the Imbued

The bond between a mantled individual and those they imbue with power is strong and often lasts a lifetime. This connection allows the mantled person to monitor the progress and well-being of their charges, offering guidance and support as needed. However, the bond can also be severed if the imbued individual strays from the path set by the mantled person or violates the terms of their agreement.

## How to do It

In all cases, any manner of beliefs, rituals, customs, or ideas can be associated with any practice of magic. What is crucial is that adherents have both the ability (when necessary) and the *fervent belief in* their magical tradition to perform magic.

A shaman that evokes Mother Gaia in order to perform healing via potions might find her ability waning when she begins to lose her way and seek out the excesses of materialistic, corporate life. This is because she is losing her *belief* in her practice and not because of some innate 'magicality' of the natural earth vs. material living.

## Dreamers

**Dreamers** are a subtype of magic users quite different from the rest. Born with an innate connection to the Void, Dreamers are able to shift reality in ways that are almost godlike, yet are wholly bound to an existence of constantly straddling two planes of reality: the material and the Void. While many do not describe this as something to suffer (indeed, those few Dreamers that exist live lives of extreme power), Dreamers will forever be set apart from all other types of beings.

Dreamers are necessary for things that would be wholly impossible even with magic, such as the great acts of reality-warping that allowed for the ancient Star-Vessels that once sailed the cosmic oceans to cross the vast distances between the stars.

However, there are no more than 3 confirmed Dreamers currently known to be alive:

1. Her Holiness, the Divine Voice and Leader of the Angelic Choir, Seraphina the Radiant.
2. A mysterious figure known only as the "Wanderer," rumored to travel the Unknown Wastes in search of lost knowledge and hidden secrets.
3. "Z," the anonymous Dreamer serving on the board of the mega-corp conglomerate known as "ManaTech," who is believed to be the driving force behind their cutting-edge magitech innovations and breakthroughs.

### Dreamers and the Void

Dreamers' innate connection to the Void allows them to perceive and manipulate the fabric of reality in ways that defy conventional understanding. This connection is both a source of incredible power and a burden, as Dreamers must constantly navigate the boundary between the material world and the Void.

### The Role of Dreamers

Due to their unique abilities, Dreamers often find themselves in positions of great responsibility and influence. They may serve as leaders, advisors, or agents of change, using their powers to reshape reality for the betterment of all.

### The Limits of Dreamer Power

Despite their seemingly godlike abilities, Dreamers are not without limits. The power they wield comes at a cost, as they must continually balance their connection to the Void with their ties to the material world
